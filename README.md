# Welcome to a repository of my Inventions
Haha. In all seriousness, this is a place for interview practice, and to prove to you that I know how to test my own code.

## What's here
Currently, just a simple linked list implementation. I wrote a few tests but nothing special. I plan to revisit this repository over summer 2018 so that I can stay sharp with my skills, and implement some new things.
